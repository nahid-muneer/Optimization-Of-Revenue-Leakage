# Optimizing Revenue Leakage and Profitability in the Hospitality Sector

This repo is for showcasing the codes that I used to generate graphs using Python for a consulting project. Below is the context of the project.

This report aims to uncover and address revenue leakage across the hotel portfolio by analyzing historical booking and performance data. The goal is to build a data-backed framework for identifying operational inefficiencies, proposing strategic interventions, and quantifying business impact.

The study leverages granular transactional data from hotel bookings, room categories, and temporal calendars to understand behavioral patterns of guests across multiple segments, such as business vs. leisure travelers, weekday vs. weekend stays, and direct vs. OTA bookings. The scope of this project includes identifying systemic leakage in revenue realization, analyzing underperforming room types and services, and proposing strategic interventions that are both data-backed and commercially feasible.

The analysis was performed using internal datasets:
fact_bookings.csv – Detailed booking-level transactions.
fact_aggregated_bookings.csv – Summary-level booking metrics.
dim_rooms.csv – data on room categories.
dim_hotels.csv – Hotel classification and location info.
dim_date.csv – Time-based breakdowns.

My analytical approach combined exploratory data analysis (EDA), root cause analysis (RCA), revenue metric calculations and business scenario modeling.

The report outlines key insights, strategic recommendations, and revenue impact forecasts designed to support leadership decisions and inform revenue management strategies.
